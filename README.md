# 🚀 Pathfinder – Interactive Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathfinder is a simple, interactive pathfinding visualizer built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It lets you draw walls, set start and target nodes, and watch the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm find the shortest path in real time.

This project is designed to help beginners *see* how pathfinding algorithms work — step-by-step, with smooth animations and a clean UI.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎨 **Interactive Grid** – Click and drag to build walls.
- 🟢 **Start & Target Nodes** – Clearly marked for easy navigation.
- 🔵 **BFS Visualization** – Shows how BFS explores the grid layer by layer.
- ⭐ **Shortest Path Animation** – Highlights the final path found by the algorithm.
- ♻️ **Reset Function** – Quickly clear and rebuild the grid.
- 💡 **Pure JavaScript Implementation** – No libraries, no frameworks.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the visualizer in a browser.
2. Click and drag on the grid to create walls.
3. Press **“Run BFS Algorithm”** to watch the visualization.
4. Press **“Reset Board”** to clear everything and start again.

That’s it — simple and fun!
